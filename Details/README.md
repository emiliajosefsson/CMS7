# Millhouse

Our task was to create a simple blog system with two users (admin, user). The user "admin" should be able to create, update and delete entries and comments. The user "user" are only able to view entries and add comments to the posted entries.

The blog system should have a user friendly interface and focuses on people with low computer skills. 

## Installation

To use this blog create a database named "Millhouse" and then run the SQL query to create the tables. 

## Authors
During this project we have used the agile software development technique pair programming.
